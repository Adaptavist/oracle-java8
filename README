Java 8 is still a work in progress and so is this package. Things can
change anytime without any compatibility concerns.

1. Introduction

Java 8 packages for Debian.

2. Supported Debian versions

So far packages were tested on following Debian versions:
- jessie i386/amd64
- wheezy i386/amd64

Packages are compatible with "official" Debian ones of Java 6, but
have a lower priority (use update-java-alternatives if you have Java 6
already installed).

I do not have resources to test packages on Ubuntu. However, if one
finds any problem on Ubuntu, feel free to report an issue and I will
try to resolve it.

3. Usage

To create packages on your own:
- apt-get install dpkg-dev
- git clone git://github.com/rraptorr/oracle-java8.git
- cd oracle-java8
- Download jdk-8-ea-bin-b88-linux-i586-02_may_2013.tar.gz or
  jdk-8-ea-bin-b88-linux-x64-02_may_2013.tar.gz from
  http://jdk8.java.net/download.html (depending on your architecture)
- dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us
- install any missing packages that dpkg-buildpackage complains about
  and repeat

4. Legal

Oracle does not permit to distribute repackaged binaries of Java, so
be advised that hosting any public repository with Java packages is
probably illegal (at least in some parts of the world).

On the other hand, this repository contains only scripts, that allows
one to repackage Oracle Java in Debian friendly way. No binaries are
or will be hosted.
